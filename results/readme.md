# ðŸŽ¥ Results Folder â€“ DLStreamer Project

This directory contains **screen recordings** from the execution of the DLStreamer pipeline as part of the Intel Unnati Internship project.

## ðŸ§ª Contents:

- `1_stream.mp4` â€“ CPU pipeline running with one stream (smooth)
- `2_streams.mp4` â€“ CPU pipeline running with two streams (moderate load)
- `4_streams.mp4` - CPU pipeline running with four streams (heavy load)
- `gpu_execution` â€“ GPU-based execution attempt that resulted in a crash or fallback
- `crash.mp4`- CPU execution crashes with 10 concurrent streams

> These recordings help visualize the pipeline behavior under different workloads and hardware targets.
